example_summary = ['The paper presents an algorithm for finding an admissible set in an argumentation framework using a random walker approach. The algorithm assigns labels to arguments based on the path the walker took and the neighborhood of the current argument. The paper also includes a comparison of different solvers, analyses of space and time complexity, and a proof of correctness of the algorithm. The implementation includes unit and integration tests, and the paper concludes with a discussion of formal argumentation and its advantages over other AI approaches.', 'This paper discusses argumentation frameworks, which are used to represent arguments and their relationships in a graphical manner. The paper focuses on the concept of admissible sets, which are sets of acceptable arguments that meet certain conditions. The paper also describes different types of extensions, which are sets of arguments that are justifiable as a whole. The paper introduces an algorithm to find an admissible set in a given argumentation framework. The algorithm uses random walkers to traverse the framework and label arguments as in, out, or undec. The algorithm terminates when it finds an admissible set or determines that no such set exists.', "The paper describes an algorithm for finding an admissible set in an argumentation framework. The algorithm uses random walkers that move in the direction of parent arguments and label arguments as in, out, or undec. The algorithm also includes a children labeling algorithm that ensures the correct labeling of child arguments based on their parent's label. The paper provides a formal description of the algorithm and an example to illustrate its use.", 'The paper describes an algorithm for labeling arguments in an argumentation framework, using random walkers. The algorithm is evaluated and compared to other solvers, and limitations of the algorithm are discussed. The paper also includes examples of how the algorithm fails to terminate in cases of uneven cycles and premature child labeling. The algorithm is implemented in Python and uses Matplotlib, Pandas, and NumPy libraries.',
                   'The paper compares the performance of a random walk reasoning solver to three other solvers using graphs with different numbers of arguments and edges. The solvers are evaluated based on whether they return consistent results over multiple runs, how well they perform compared to a ground truth (chosen as µ-toksia), and their average runtime to solve a problem. The results show that the random walk reasoning solver performs worse than the other solvers in terms of mispredictions, but is consistent in its results over multiple runs. The other solvers, Pyglaf and Heureka, perform well in terms of mispredictions and runtime.', 'The paper compares the performance of different solvers in solving argumentation problems. Confusion matrices are used to display the accuracy of the solvers, with Heureka and Pyglaf performing better than the random walk reasoning solver. The paper also analyzes the time and space complexity of the algorithms used by the solvers. However, the comparison is limited due to a small number of example instances and differences in programming languages.', 'The paper presents an algorithm for determining the admissibility of a set of arguments in a graph. The algorithm has a time complexity of O(|A|^3) and a space complexity of O(|A|). The paper provides a detailed analysis of the algorithm and proves its correctness under certain assumptions. The algorithm starts with a set of arguments and labels them as either in or out. It then iteratively labels the parents of in-labeled arguments until no more labels can be added. The algorithm returns a set of admissible arguments.', 'The paper describes an algorithm for finding admissible sets in argumentation frameworks using random walks. The algorithm works by labeling arguments as "in" or "out" based on the termination of random walks starting from each argument. The algorithm guarantees that if the start argument is assumed to be part of an admissible set, the algorithm must return a set of arguments that is necessarily admissible. The paper also describes the implementation of the algorithm using Java and Docker, and provides instructions for usage and testing. The software follows the hexagonal architecture pattern for easy separation of domain logic and communication.', "The paper describes the architecture and implementation of a software program for random walk reasoning. The program follows the hexagonal architecture pattern and is divided into three large packages: domain, application, and adapter. The domain layer contains all classes related to the actual logic of the program, while the application layer provides essential building blocks like Graphs, Labelings, and Arguments. The adapter layer is responsible for communication to and from the program and makes use of the library Picoli to describe command line arguments. The program can be executed using Maven and its unit tests results can be displayed. Overall, the paper provides a detailed overview of the software's architecture and implementation.", "The paper describes the implementation of an algorithm based on random walkers assigning labels to arguments, which is implemented by three separate layers responsible for domain logic, encapsulating use cases, and organizing communication to and from the program. The program has weaknesses, including being prone to cycling if the graph contains cycles with an uneven number of arguments and even cycles may cause the algorithm to find smaller than possible admissible sets that the start argument belongs to. The evaluation shows that the random walk solver performs the worst if compared to the other solvers on the basis of µ-toksia's results as ground truth. The implemented solver also scores the worst in the speed comparison between solvers, and there remain many possibilities to improve upon the solver in terms of speed and precision.", 'The paper provides a list of references related to computational models of argumentation, including papers on solver requirements, explaining the outcome of knowledge-based systems, foundations of implementations for formal argumentation, and stochastic local search algorithms for abstract argumentation under stable semantics, among others. The references also include tools and libraries such as AssertJ, JUnit 5, Mockito, Picoli, Amazon Corretto, JaCoCo, NumPy, Matplotlib, Docker, Apache Maven, and Tweety. The paper also mentions the third international competition on computational models of argumentation and the participation of the µ-toksia abstract argumentation reasoner.']
